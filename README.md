### UMich EECS-498-007: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This repository contains my independent work on assignments and projects inspired by the publicly available materials of UMich EECS-498-007, completed during December 2024 - January 2025. All work was done personally in my dormitory at École Polytechnique over the Christmas holiday.

#### **Course Overview**  
EECS-498 is an undergraduate/graduate course focused on the fundamentals of computer vision and deep learning. The course covers a wide range of topics, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs). The assignments and projects are implemented **from scratch** using PyTorch.

#### **Assignment Overview**
- **Assignment 1**: Pytorch 101, KNN from scratch.
- **Assignment 22**: Linear classification, Softmax, SVM, Two-layer neural network, including gradient calculus and backpropagation, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization.
- **Assignment 3**: Fully connected neural network, convolutional neural network, batch normalization, dropout, pooling, Sanity check, overfit small data.
