### UMich EECS-498-007: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This is a personal repo for the UMich-EECS-498-007 course assignments and projects, during Dec 2024 - Jan 2025.

This coursework is done by myself in my dormitory in [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) during the wonderful Christmas holiday, and is not related to UMich EECS-498-007 course nor with Ecole Polytechnique.

#### **Course Overview**  
EECS-498 is an undergraduate/graduate course focused on the fundamentals of computer vision and deep learning. The course covers a wide range of topics, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs). The assignments and projects are implemented **from scratch** using PyTorch.

#### **Assignment Overview**
- **Assignment 1**: Pytorch 101, KNN from scratch.
- **Assignment 22**: Linear classification, Softmax, SVM, Two-layer neural network, including gradient calculus.
